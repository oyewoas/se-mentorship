## What a data structure is
Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a way in which it can be efficiently accessed, managed, and modified.

## What you understand about stacks and queues
A stack is a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out principle, that is, the last element added is the first one to be removed. Common stack operations are push (add an item to the end of the stack) and pop (remove the top item from the top of a stack). A real-world analogy of a Stack is a stack of books. To access the nth element in a stack, we have to start by iterating over the elements from the top of the stack.

A queue is data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out principle, meaning the first element added is the first one to be removed. Common queue operations are enqueue (add an item to the end) and dequeue (remove the item from the front of the queue). A real-world analogy of a Queue is a queue of people. 

## The key differences between a Stack and a Queue
**Principles**
- Stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle.
- Queues follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. 

**Operations**
- Stacks has these basic operations: push(), pop(), peek()
- Queues has these basic operations: enqueue(), dequeue()
